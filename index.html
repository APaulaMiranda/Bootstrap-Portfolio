                    I am very passionate about Finance, Technology, Strategy and how processes' optimization fits
                    everywhere.
                    <br />
                    I have five years of experience in Business Research and Financial Services. I am currently working
                    in Banking Operations at N26, the mobile bank the world loves.
                    <br />
                    I love to be exposed to different cultures and have always worked in a multinational environment and
                    in different countries.
                    <br />
                    In my free time I love to run and to spend time in Nature (be it the countryside, the forest, the
                    beach or the mountain) and to watch TED Talks and Documentaries. I am fascinated about whole plant
                    based foods and how we can change the course of our lives through diet and lifestyle. I am very
                    curious about the world in general. I love people - everyone has a story and everyone has lots of
                    potential. I like team work and working for a common goal. I love how we can empower each other and
                    learn from each other. It is amazing how we can transform a team to value more than the sum of its
                    parts!
